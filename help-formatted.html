      <h4>About</h4>
      <p class="bigpoint">This tool helps you visualize notes across the neck of your instrument.
      </p>
      <p><img src="img/help/blank-song.png" width="80%"></p>
      <p>Supported are: guitar, bass, mandolin, cello, uke.  All support left-handed players.
         A reference 2-octave piano is also included.
         Each instrument may have multiple tunings.
      </p>
      <p>For example a six-string guitar could be in Standard tuning,
         or it could be in Drop-D or DADGAD.
      </p>
      <p><img width="80%" src="img/help/tunings-table.png"></p>
      <p><small><i>We even support the <a href="https://stick.com/instruments/tunings/all/">Chapman Stick</a>!</i></small>
         <br>
         <img width="95%" src="img/help/chapman-stick.png">
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Or you could really get
         lost in the world of alternate tunings and follow <a href="https://ragajunglism.org/">George Howlett's RÄ€GA JUNGLISM</a>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Here are a P4-tuning 6-string guitar, and a Standard-tuning left-hand 6-string,
         both playing a cowboy-chord D-major, and showing those notes across the necks.
         They are in editing mode with titles and controls, and are displayed in the same workspace.
      </p>
      <p><img width="600px" src="img/help/two-guitars-p4-std-L-editing.png"></p>
      <p>Here they are in full-screen mode.</p>
      <p><img width="600px" src="img/help/two-guitars-p4-std-L-fullscreen.png"></p>
      <p class="bigpoint">You can assign colors and styles to notes.</p>
      <p>For example: named notes (C#), chord notes (I, III, V), scale notes (natural minor),
         mode notes (Mixolydian), enclosure notes, or passing tones can all have different colors and styles so you can visualize these patterns up the neck.
      </p>
      <p><img  width="600px" src="img/help/c-mixolydian.png"></p>
      <p class="bigpoint">You can create Sections, and Beats within Sections.</p>
      <p>A Section is like a bar or multiple bars where the underlying notes, modes, and keys don't change.
         Within a section, a beat can highlight any notes.  The next beat could highlight different notes, but "Named Notes" stay for the whole section.
      </p>
      <p>Each new section gets: new keys, number of beats, caption, enharmonic sharps/flats.</p>
      <p>That is, a Song has one or more Sections, and each Section has one or more Beats.</p>
      <p>Each beat's length (time duration) is determined with the "BPM", or "Beats Per Minute" setting,
         and there can be any number of beats per section, from 1 to some large integer.
      </p>
      <p class="bigpoint">You can then loop over the Beats in one Section, or in all Sections.</p>
      <p><img src="img/help/transport.png"></p>
      <p  class="bigpoint">You can save your songs to share with someone or to come back and practice them later.</p>
      <p>Within Sections, one key is the root key for the band, and optionally, a separate root key for the "lead".
         <i>("Bill is playing F# over Dave and the band's B".)</i>
      </p>
      <p>To show four chord changes over, say, a Dmin mood, you could use one Section with four Beats,
         or you could use four Sections.
      </p>
      <p>With four beats in one Section, the neck would look like, say,
         a sea of bluish notes with several notes highlighted in golden backlight.
      <ul>
         <li>the chord changes would be shown by MultiHighlight or by MidiHighlight,
            which highlight just the relevant notes across the neck(s) with golden box-shadows.
         </li>
         <li>the band is in multiple blue colors, e.g. slightly different colors for the I, the V, the minor 3, the Seven.
         </li>
         <li>these notes keep the same position and color for all beats in this Section.
         </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Or, with four Sections, the neck would look like a sea of bluish notes, and as each section is played,
         you'd see notes change style and color, forming one chord per Section with their color changes,
         that are different than the Dmin mood,
         and so draw your eyes to the chosen notes/positions within a whole fabric of playable notes.
         You can also add beats (Highlights) to these Sections for more expression.
      </p>
      <p>I find it essential, when communicating with musicians, to "think Piano".  So in addition to the note
         markers, or fret positions that you should play, should NOT play, could play...etc.,
         I have styled the guitar necks with piano key coloring embeded as ivory and ebony box inlay,
         though in software they look more like lit-up MIDI controllers built
         into your guitar neck like Guitar Hero with half of Synesthesia bolted on.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="70%" src="img/help/highlights.png"></p>
      <p>That is, <i>ahem,</i> a Song has one or more Sections, and each Section has one or more Beats.</p>

      <p><small><i>Classical music theory provides only 7 note names, and then expects you to glue on words
         like "augmented", "diminished", "altered", "major", and "minor".
         The problem is the symbols can change, so that for example the "II" becomes "ii" if diatonic,
         which makes it minor.  Add Jazz people and you'll hear "flat 9" or "the flat 2".
         And half of the Classical folks reading wouldn't agree that it would be correct
         to notate a 12-tone chromatic scale thusly:
         I ii II iii III IV v V vi VI vii VII.  Because ii represents the minor mode and not the flatted II.
         These examples don't explain the problems well, or even correctly, but that's
         kind of the point.  These systems do not precisely address what I want to
         express: a unique set of single letter names for each of the twelve tones of the chromatic scale.
         I do this by assigning names concretely, which apply in any 12-tone
         playing, assuming you know where the "root" is, or the key of the band or dominant instrument,
         usually the bass player.  I used symbols familiar to Jazz and Session players, and added a few new ones
         where singular, concrete names were needed.
         </i></small>
      </p>
      <p>Features of the system
      <ul>
         <li>The "Name" is my name for that symbol and function</li>
         <li>The "Pronunciation" is my way of singing that symbol, for example "m" is named "mi" and is pronounced like the English word "my".</li>
         <li>"Symbol" is also called Function, Function Name, or Note</li>
         <li>A &Theta; is always 7 steps up from the root.</li>
         <li>If you change root, the new &Theta; is calculated as 7 steps above the new root.</li>
         <li>A III is always a major third.</li>
         <li>An m is always a minor third, and so on.</li>
         <li>It's easy to think of the notes as simple: one character, one syllable</li>
         <li>I think the easiest to sing sounds are shown in my pronounciation--one syllable, ends in vowel.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h5>Alternatives</h5>
      <p>
         You can change the NoteFunction symbols to any string or HTML Entity you choose.  You just need to edit the array
         in View | Function Symbols.  This is a Javascript array, so the commas, quotes and braces must remain exactly as they are--just
         change the values between the quote marks.
      </p>
      <p>They default to this:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["I","&amp;tau;","II","m","III","IV","&amp;Theta;","V","&amp;sigma;","6","&amp;delta;","&amp;Delta;"]</div>
      <br />
      <p>
      <img src="img/help/defaultNoteFunctionEntities.png">
      </p>
      <p>Or you could go crazy and use lots of HTML Entities:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["&amp;#x21BA;","&amp;tau;","&amp;empty;","&amp;nabla;","&amp;oplus;","&amp;int;","&amp;Theta;","&amp;otimes;","&amp;sigma;","&amp;prod;","&amp;infin;","&amp;ocirc;"]</div>
      <br />
      <p>
      <img src="img/help/customNoteFunctionEntities.png">
      </p>
      <p>Or use regular strings, such as Solfage:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["Do","Ra","Re","Ma","Mi","Fa","Se","Sol","Le","La","Ta","Ti"]</div>

Note:
    Highlights are not kept in the cell if you go to the next Section.
    So if you want highlights, you must record them in individual Beats within Setions.

    Tiny notes and Bends both record in beats, and persist in Sections. Single Notes too.

    NamedNotes persist in Sections, but can't be recorded in Beats.

      <h4>Techie Bits</h4>
      <pre>
    In Chrome::Inspect you can use Developer tools to directly access the ObjectModel of the Song.
    Currently through a global gSong, but more properly through getSong().

    Synopsize the "tables" collection:
    gSong.frames.forEach(function(a){console.log("id"+JSON.stringify(a.tables))});

    Delete all played notes (tables) in a song, leaving Named and Recorded notes only :
    gSong.frames.forEach(function(a){a.tables = {}; });
    gSong.frames.forEach(function(a){a.recordedNotes = {}; });

    gSong.frames.forEach(function(a){a.sharps = true; });

         the neck, <span class="productsmall">infinite-neck</span> shows where the piano keys would lie on your tuning.
         In most Themes, cells have a white background for white keys on the piano, and a gray background for black keys on the piano.
         Tunings may change on your guitar, but a C is always a white key, and a C&sharp; (or D&flat;) is always a black key.
         You can switch to Theme "Coffee Brown" to see a keyboard that does not have piano key backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>Here are six "cells" showing four white-keys, and two black-keys. A "Single" note is
         placed on A, and a "NamedNote" is placed on F&sharp; which selects <u>all</u> F&sharp;s.
      </p>
      <p><img src="img/help/one-cell.png"></p>
      <p>Click a Palette note kind (Named, Single, Tiny, Bend...).</p>
      <p><img src="img/help/palette-note-types.png"></p>
      <p>Click a Palette radio button to select a note role, e.g. Root or Chord,</p>
      <p><img src="img/help/palette.png"></p>
      <p>or just some color you like.</p>
      <p><img src="img/help/palette-more.png"></p>
      <p>Click any cell.  Cells of that note name turn the selected color.
      <ul>
         <li>e.g. Click C, E, and G.</li>
         <li>Now with "Named" notes, you have all Cmajor chords shown.  </li>
         <li>With "Single" notes, you just
            have the cells you clicked.
         </li>
         <li>With "Tiny" notes and "Bend" notes, you'll have smaller note functions placed over the cells.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Click the Clear radio button, then any note name you want to clear.
         (These are specific to the kind of note, so also select the kind of note.)
      </p>
      <p>
         Check the 'Highlight' checkbox to put a border around just one square,
         e.g. to highlight the actual chord voicing you would play.
         With "Pitch" and "Multi" notes, you'll just highlight those notes:
      </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
         <li><b>Pitch</b> shows all MIDI pitches on that instrument,
            <br>
            <img src="img/help/pitch.png">
         </li>
         <li><b>Multi</b> lets you highlight multiple notes at once, by played position.
            Here we are showing the D-major chord, with a handy dominant seven chord
            highlighted in magenta, which we could play as a substitution if we wanted a Blues seventh.
            <br>
            <img src="img/help/multi-highlight.png">
         </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Click the 'keep' radio button, to avoid making changes when scrolling
         around.
      </p>
      <p><img src="img/help/keep.png"></p>
      <p>Click the 'clear' radio button to delete a note of the kind selected (Named, Single, Tiny, Bend).</p>
      <p><img src="img/help/clear.png"></p>
      <p>Look under the "Tunings" menu to turn on and off various installed tunings,
         and customize them (number of frets, left-handed).

      <p>Beware that keyboard shortcuts may be captured by textboxes such as the song name or BPM, or even the
         radio buttons of colors on the Palette.  Hit <span class="key">ESC</span> to close up menus to ensure the keyboard shortcuts documented
         here behave as expected.

      <p class="GUIReference">Menu :: View :: Natural fret widths</p>
      <p>When checked, pressing <span class="key">w</span> or <span class="key">W</span> while menus are closed will increase/decrease the
         width of the frets, but will use the natural mathematical proportion of frets, such that they
         get smaller up the neck. This is the default.  When not checked, the <span class="key">w</span> and <span class="key">W</span> keys still increase and decrease, but all frets have
         the same width.

      <p>When checked, pressing <span class="key">t</span> or <span class="key">T</span> while menus are closed will transpose
         any named-notes, preserving their role colors/styles. Pressing <span class="key">j</span> or <span class="key">J</span>
         will transpose by fourths,
         or <b><u>J</u></b>ump strings up or down.
         When not checked, these keys cannot
         trigger transposition, which is the safe default.

         key and arrow keys are not overriden,

         But here's a link to the application page: <a href="index.html">Infinite Neck</a>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <a name="why"></a>
      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>Obviously, the neck is NOT infinite,
         since we play instruments with a fixed number of strings, and a playable number of frets,
         generating a listenable set of tones.
         (But you <i>could</i> have an infinite number of
         frets, since they get infinitely smaller as you approach the bridge, albeit infinitely more unplayable.)
      </p>
      <p>And thinking about the neck as infinite helped me to learn the repeatable patterns of the neck, and not
         be rooted to the nut or open strings as much.  <i><small>In fact, I use open strings more now as drone notes
         while I'm playing high up on the neck, because going up the neck doesn't unroot me from the scale I'm playing.</small></i>
      </p>
      <p>The point is that the instrument that
         got me started on this madness was the Strandberg Boden <b><i>8-string</i></b> guitar with <b>24 frets</b>!  It seemed infinite to me!
      </p>
      <p><img  width="40%" src="img/help/strandberg-boden.png"></p>
      <p>Also,
         deciding to play this beast meant that when switching to 8-string bass (or 5-string bass),
         I'd have to know different layouts than Standard guitar tuning.
         So I decided for my own practice, I would use Perfect-Fourth-Tuning (P4)
         on this 8-string guitar and all my basses.  Soon, the
         logic and playability of this P4 system led me to convert some of my 6-string guitars to P4.
         My soloing and comping
         advanced remarkably.  <i><small>I never realized that the part of my brain that likes to improvise
         gets all anxious and goes away when I hit that major third between the G and B strings
         and I play a real clam because I'm missing a half-step.</small></i>
      </p>
      <p>Along the way, I had to sort out where my Classical training and Jazz training had different names
         for the pitches of a scale, and what to call these enharmonically <i><small>
         (classical purists note--here we show your choice of [all sharps] or [all flats] in any key,
         per Section, but no weird enharmonic names or mixed sharps and flats--sorry, no B# or C## for you!)</small></i>,
         and what to call these pitches when the key changed,
         but the played note was the same.
         <i>e.g. the band jumps from the key of A to the key of D# and you want to play the minor third function in the new key,
         or you want to know what that minor third you were playing in A means, now that everyone else is playing in D#.
         <small>"Girl from Ipanema" anyone?</small></i>
      <p>So I decided to share this tool and to include other tunings, and ambidexterity,
         so you can use this tool in your instrument and tuning of choice.
      </p>
      <p>Open some of the example files to see it in action, or watch some of my videos.</p>
      <p>You'll want to use this tool to:
      <ul>
         <li>Understand Laramie's system of scale note/function naming (a hybrid between Jazz and Classical conventions),
            and its uses for singing, playing, and visualizing modal and modeless playing.
         <li>Try the benefits of Ebony/Ivory visualization from the piano, brought to the guitar.
            Especially when learning modes or playing in "The People's Key".
         <li>Apprehend the patterns formed by scales and chords across and up the neck.
         <li>Move these patterns around the neck.
         <li>Watch lead patterns moving against patterns of comping, and practice improvising over the patterns and changes.
         <li>See the difference between tunings in real time
            (pull up two tunings and press Ctrl-minus in your browser to make them both fit).
         <li>Practice a song someone has saved in some other tuning, by switching it to your tuning.
      </ul>
