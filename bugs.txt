=============BUGS===================
20240419: Section:NamedNotes => Stylesheet :: FindColor with AutoColor yields the weird green5 that means lookupcolor failed.

TODO: 20240325 When you add a singleNote with a real color button, then go to automaticColor, the singleNote gets autocolored, when it should retain the color if placed by the user.
      Question: how is this really different from the user placing real colors, or even noteScale then going to autocolor.
      Seems like it should be an override.

TODO: 20240325 code a section-level button to "print" autocolors to Model notes.

Can't export low highlighted notes from P4 to MIDI8x8.

LH bends all seem to come out up-down after export.

This code is hosing whatever came from the theme.  But not sure if I want it.
I just want the font color in the theme  for showing the All Note names when the cell color is weird.
if (gLastBlackBackgroundColor && gLastWhiteBackgroundColor){
        $('.noteWhiteKey').css({color: "transparent"});   //gLastWhiteBackgroundColor});
        $('.noteBlackKey').css({color: "transparent"});   //gLastBlackBackgroundColor});
        console.log("gLastBlackBackgroundColor:"+gLastBlackBackgroundColor);

        basically, got it working, but other themes set "noteWhiteKeyFontColor": "#331e01",
        "noteBlackKeyFontColor": "#331e01" so you have to redo this in the theme.  Default theme does "transparent" so a theme can still override.

Transform doesn't erase note correctly.

Fill doesn't erase notes correctly.

Clone sticks new ones at the end, should be just next.

=============FEATURES===============

User-customizable highlight colorSingleNotes

User-customizable button spacing: 1) between table cells, and 2) IvoryEbony space.

=============FIXED==================
mix-blend-mode is screwed.  Hard to turn it off, in noteTransparent. [FIX: added noteTransparent to gNOTE_COLORS]

Can't use + button to add more beats.

Bends aren't persisting.
