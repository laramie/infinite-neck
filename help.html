    <p class="bigpoint">This tool, <span class="productsmall">infinite-neck</span>, helps you visualize notes across the neck of your instrument.
        </p>

        <p><img src="img/help/infinite-neck-visualization.png" width="80%"></p>


    <p>The fretboard is displayed as a spreadsheet-like table with cells representing each fret/string position.
        Clicking on cells puts "notes" on the virtual neck/fretboard,
        showing where you'll play them on the real fretboard of your instrument.  You can add bars and beats, and loop the song.
        There's music theory baked into the tool, so you can automatically
        highlight all legal notes in G Mixolydian, for example, with separate sets of colors for
        chord notes, root, scale notes, passing-tones, and blue-notes.
    </p>
    <p><span class="productsmall">infinite-neck</span> has the following uses for practice and sharing:
        <br>&check;&nbsp;writing down new-to-you and interesting chord fingerings.
        <br>&check;&nbsp;capturing a concrete way to play a song.
        <br>&check;&nbsp;communicating the fabric of a sound: the possible notes and their moods.
        <br>&check;&nbsp;creating art with the patterns of notes, another way to internalize the layout and relationships of notes.
        <br>&check;&nbsp;improvising over the changes while looping.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can run the program from my website:

    <h3>Instruments</h3>
    <p>
        &check;&nbsp;Supported instruments: guitar, bass, mandolin, cello, piano, midi-pads, uke, and banjo.
        <br>
        &check;&nbsp;All support left-handed and right-handed players.
        <br>
        &check;&nbsp;Each instrument may have multiple tunings.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, a left-handed, six-string guitar could be in Standard tuning,
        or it could be in P4, Drop-D, or DADGAD.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is the tunings table, which shows all tunings for all supported instruments. (<small><i>It's easy to add your own tunings.</i></small>)

<h3>infinite-neck Walk-through</h3>


<p>Here is a blank song, with a Theme that shows the piano key coloring scheme (i.e. Ebony/Ivory) as a backdrop for each fret:
    <br />
    <img src="img/help/blank-song.png" width="80%"></p>

    <p>Here are a P4-tuning 6-string guitar, and a Standard-tuning left-hand 6-string,
        both playing a cowboy-chord D-major, and showing those notes across the necks.
        They are in editing mode with titles and controls, and are displayed in the same workspace.
    </p>
    <p><img width="600px" src="img/help/two-guitars-p4-std-L-editing.png"></p>


    <p>Here they are in full-screen mode.</p>
    <p><img width="600px" src="img/help/two-guitars-p4-std-L-fullscreen.png"></p>

    <p class="bigpoint">You can assign colors and styles to notes.</p>
    <p>For example: named notes (C#), chord notes (I, III, V), scale notes (natural minor),
    mode notes (Mixolydian), enclosure notes, or passing tones can all have different colors and styles so you can visualize these patterns up the neck.
    </p>

    <p><img  width="600px" src="img/help/c-mixolydian.png"></p>

    <p class="bigpoint">You can create Sections, and Beats within Sections.</p>
    <p>A Section is like a bar or multiple bars where the underlying notes, modes, and keys don't change.
    Within a section, a beat can highlight any notes.  The next beat could highlight different notes, but "Named Notes" stay for the whole section.
    </p>

    <p>Each new section gets: new keys, number of beats, caption, enharmonic sharps/flats.</p>

    <p>That is, a Song has one or more Sections, and each Section has one or more Beats.</p>


        <p>Each beat's length (time duration) is determined with the "BPM", or "Beats Per Minute" setting,
            and there can be any number of beats per section, from 1 to some large integer.</p>

        <p class="bigpoint">You can then loop over the Beats in one Section, or in all Sections.</p>

            <p><img src="img/help/transport.png">
            <br><i>Transport showing Section 1 of 5, on Beat 3 of 4.</i></p>

        <p  class="bigpoint">You can save your songs to share with someone or to come back and practice them later.</p>

    <p>Within Sections, one key is the root key for the band, and optionally, a separate root key for the "lead".
        <i>("Bill is playing F# over Dave and the band's B".)</i></p>


    <p>To show four chord changes over, say, a Dmin mood, you could use one Section with four Beats,
        or you could use four Sections.</p>

        <p>With four beats in one Section, the neck would look like, say,
            a sea of bluish notes with several notes highlighted in golden backlight.
            <ul>
                <li>the chord changes would be shown by MultiHighlight or by MidiHighlight,
                    which highlight just the relevant notes across the neck(s) with golden box-shadows.
                </li>
                <li>the band is in multiple blue colors, e.g. slightly different colors for the I, the V, the minor 3, the Seven.
                </li>
                <li>these notes keep the same position and color for all beats in this Section.
                </li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Or, with four Sections, the neck would look like a sea of bluish notes, and as each section is played,
            you'd see notes change style and color, forming one chord per Section with their color changes,
            that are different than the Dmin mood,
        and so draw your eyes to the chosen notes/positions within a whole fabric of playable notes.
        You can also add beats (Highlights) to these Sections for more expression.</p>

        <p>I find it essential, when communicating with musicians, to "think Piano".  So in addition to the note
            markers, or fret positions that you <i>should</i> play, <i>should <b>not</b></i> play, <i>could</i> play...etc.,
            I have styled the guitar necks with piano key coloring embeded as ivory and ebony box inlay,
        though in software they look more like lit-up MIDI controllers built
        into your guitar neck like Guitar Hero with half of Synesthesia bolted on.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="70%" src="img/help/highlights.png"></p>

    <p>That is, <i>ahem,</i> a Song has one or more Sections, and each Section has one or more Beats.</p>

<a name="why"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Why</h2>

         <p>Obviously, the neck is NOT infinite,
             since we play instruments with a fixed number of strings, and a playable number of frets,
             generating a listenable set of tones.
             (But you <i>could</i> have an infinite number of
             frets, since they get infinitely smaller as you approach the bridge, albeit infinitely more unplayable.)</p>

        <p>And thinking about the neck as infinite helped me to learn the repeatable patterns of the neck, and not
             be rooted to the nut or open strings as much.  <i><small>In fact, I use open strings more now as drone notes
             while I'm playing high up on the neck, because going up the neck doesn't unroot me from the scale I'm playing.</small></i>
        </p>

         <p>The point is that the instrument that
             got me started on this madness was the Strandberg Boden <b><i>8-string</i></b> guitar with <b>24 frets</b>!  It seemed infinite to me!  </p>

        <p><img  width="40%" src="img/help/strandberg-boden.png"></p>
         <p>Also,
             deciding to play this beast meant that when switching to 8-string bass (or 5-string bass),
             I'd have to know different layouts than Standard guitar tuning.
             So I decided for my own practice, I would use Perfect-Fourth-Tuning (P4)
             on this 8-string guitar and all my basses.  Soon, the
             logic and playability of this P4 system led me to convert some of my 6-string guitars to P4.
             My soloing and comping
             advanced remarkably.  <i><small>I never realized that the part of my brain that likes to improvise
             gets all anxious and goes away when I hit that major third between the G and B strings
             and I play a real clam because I'm missing a half-step.</small></i></p>

         <p>Along the way, I had to sort out where my Classical training and Jazz training had different names
                 for the pitches of a scale, and what to call these enharmonically,
                 and what to call these pitches when the key changed,
                 but the played note was the same.

                 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9758;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>e.g. the band jumps from the key of A
                     to the key of D# and you want to play the minor third function in the new key,
                 or you want to know what that minor third you were playing in A means,
                 now that everyone else is playing in D#.
                 <small>"<a target="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFWCbGzxofU">Girl from Ipanema</a>" anyone?</small></i>

                 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9758;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Classical purists note--here
                     we show your choice of [all sharps] or [all flats] in any key,
                 per Section, but no weird enharmonic names or mixed sharps and flats--sorry,
                 no B# or C## for you!</i>
                 <br>

         <p>So I decided to share this tool and to include other tunings, and ambidexterity,
             so you can use this tool in your instrument and tuning of choice.
             </p>

         <p>Open some of the example files under "File | Open song from: [Song Library]"
             to see it in action, or watch some of the videos on
             our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV4jldN8QYI3SEchaKVF-HQTfMugR4tVm">youtube chanel</a>.
         </p>
         <p>You'll want to use this tool to:
             <ul>
                 <li>Understand Laramie's system of scale note/function naming (a hybrid between Jazz and Classical conventions),

        <p><small><i>Classical music theory provides only 7 note names, and then expects you to glue on words
            like "augmented", "diminished", "altered", "major", and "minor".
            The problem is the symbols can change, so that for example the "II" becomes "ii" if diatonic,
            which makes it minor.  Add Jazz lingo and you'll hear terms like "flat 9" or "the flat 2".
            And in Classical terms it would not be correct
            to notate a 12-tone chromatic scale thusly:
            I ii II iii III IV v V vi VI vii VII.  Because ii represents the minor mode and not the flatted II.
            <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solfege#Modern_use'>Modernized Solf&#232;ge</a>
            get close, but few people use this system, and it does not have single-character symbols.

            These examples don't explain the problems well, or even correctly, but that's
            kind of the point.  These systems do not precisely address what I want to
            express: a unique set of single letter names for each of the twelve tones of the chromatic scale.
            I do this by assigning names concretely, which apply in any 12-tone
            playing, assuming you know where the "root" is, or the key of the band or dominant instrument,
            usually the bass player.  I used symbols familiar to Jazz and Session players, and added a few new ones
            where singular, concrete names were needed.
            </i></small></p>

            <p>Features of the system
                <ul>
                    <li>The "Name" is my name for that symbol and function</li>
                    <li>The "Pronunciation" is my way of singing that symbol, for example "m" is named "mi" and is pronounced like the English word "my".</li>
                    <li>"Symbol" is also called Function, Function Name, or Note</li>
                    <li>A &Theta; is always 7 steps up from the root.</li>
                    <li>If you change root, the new &Theta; is calculated as 7 steps above the new root.</li>
                    <li>A III is always a major third.</li>
                    <li>An m is always a minor third, and so on.</li>
                    <li>It's easy to think of the notes as simple: one character, one syllable</li>
                    <li>I think the easiest to sing sounds are shown in my pronounciation--one syllable, ends in vowel.</li>

          As you do that, the editing box called <b>Function Symbols</b> will get populated
          with the internal string of characters and HTML character entities.

      </p>

      <p>
            Setting the scheme <b>Function Numbers</b> for Function symbols:

        </p>

        <p>
            The Function Symbols get set to this:

        <h4>User-added alternatives</h4>
        <p>
             You can change the NoteFunction symbols to any string or HTML Entity you choose.
             A string is anything you can type on the keyboard; an HTML Entity is something like <b>&amp;blah;</b> where blah
             is some string of numbers and letters--the browser turns them into things you can't type, like symbols.
             You just need to edit the array here: <br><span class="GUIReferenceInline">View | Function Symbols</span>
        </p>

         <p>
             This is a Javascript array, so the commas, quotes and braces must remain exactly as they are--just
             change the values between the quote marks, leaving the quotes, commas and braces.
        </p>


      <br>
      <p>They default to this:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["I","&amp;tau;","II","m","III","IV","&amp;Theta;","V","&amp;sigma;","6","&amp;delta;","&amp;Delta;"]</div>
      <p>
          <img src="img/help/defaultNoteFunctionEntities.png">
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>Or you could go crazy and use lots of HTML Entities:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["&amp;#x21BA;","&amp;tau;","&amp;empty;","&amp;nabla;","&amp;oplus;","&amp;int;","&amp;Theta;","&amp;otimes;","&amp;sigma;","&amp;prod;","&amp;infin;","&amp;ocirc;"]</div>
      <br />
      <p>
          <img src="img/help/customNoteFunctionEntities.png">
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>Or use regular strings, such as Solf&#232;ge:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["Do","Ra","Re","Ma","Mi","Fa","Se","Sol","Le","La","Ta","Ti"]</div>
      <p>
          <img src="img/help/customNoteFunctionSolfage.png">

      <br>
      <p>Early in the design phase, I tried extending the Classical notation to use chord function names as note function names.
          I find it confusing, being all too similar.  So this scheme is <b><i>not</i></b> available in <span class="productsmall">infinite-neck</span>.
          <a href="http://LaramieCrocker.com/contact.html">Drop me a note</a> if you have a better idea, but here is what that would look like:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["I","ii","II","iii","III","IV","v","V","vi","VI","vii","VII"]</div>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The neck is shown as a table of cells, like a spreadsheet.
    A cell is one of the squares on the neck, and represents one fret on one string. </p>

<p><span class="productsmall">infinite-neck</span> allows you to mark the notes on your Instrument with various types of notes, shown below.  Otherwise,
    a cell is empty. (You can also choose to show all the note names in all cells, but these won't have an inner border
    or backglow behind them as notes do.)  When a cell has one or more notes or highlights, it is called "Active".</p>

<p>With the various types of notes, you can express notes which should be known anywhere on the neck, or which should
    be played exactly where shown.  With recording Beats and ordering the Sections, and with Looping, you can then arrange
    the song into a practice sheet, or a visualization of notes to play or notes you <i>could</i> play.
</p>

<p>To help you visualize
  the neck, <span class="productsmall">infinite-neck</span> shows where the piano keys would lie on your tuning.
  In most Themes, cells have a white background for white keys on the piano, and a gray background for black keys on the piano.
</p>

<p>Tunings may change on your guitar, such that a C may the the first fret on the second string, or it may be the open second string in P4.
    But a C is always a white key, and a C&sharp; (or D&flat;) is always a black key.
You can switch to Theme "Coffee Brown" to see a keyboard that does not make a distinction between black and white.
Theme "Blade" has black for black keys (but sadly, no cool hexagons because the CSS coding was too crazy).
Theme "Landau Top" has brown and tan keys (just like a cherry, stock Chevy Monte Carlo).
And any Theme can be changed by choosing
the same color for noteWhiteKeyColor and noteBlackKeyColor in the Theme.</p>

<p>Here are six cells showing four white-keys, and two black-keys. A "Single" note is
placed on A, and a "NamedNote" is placed on F&sharp; which selects <u>all</u> F&sharp;s.</p>

<p><img src="img/help/one-cell.png"></p>

<p>Click a Palette note kind (Named, Single, Tiny, Bend...).</p>

<p><img src="img/help/palette-note-types.png"></p>

<p>Click a Palette radio button to select a note role, e.g. Root or Chord,</p>

<p><img src="img/help/palette.png"></p>


<p>or just some color you like.</p>

<p><img src="img/help/palette-more.png"></p>

<p>Click any cell.  Cells of that note name turn the selected color.
        <ul>
        <li>e.g. Click C, E, and G.</li>
        <li>Now with "Named" notes, you have all Cmajor chords shown.  </li>
        <li>With "Single" notes, you just
        have the cells you clicked.</li>
        <li>With "Tiny" notes and "Bend" notes, you'll have smaller note functions placed over the cells.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p>Click the Clear radio button, then any note name you want to clear.
    (These are specific to the kind of note, so also select the kind of note.) Actually, while you have a note
    style selected, you can also
    just click the note again with the same style to remove that note--click on, click off, click on, click off. <i>Karate Kid anyone?</i>
</p>

<p>
Check the 'Highlight' checkbox to put a border around just one square,
e.g. to highlight the actual chord voicing you would play.
With "Pitch" and "Multi" notes, you'll just highlight those notes:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Pitch</b> shows all notes with one MIDI pitch highlighted in yellow outline on that instrument.
        Here it's a P4 guitar, showing all positions with MIDI pitch 62.
        <br>
    <img src="img/help/pitch.png">
    </li>
    <li><b>Multi</b> lets you highlight multiple notes at once, by played position.
        Here's that same P4 guitar.  We have, again, shown a D-major chord across the neck with NamedNotes in blue.
        The actual fingering we'll start with is shown with SingleNotes in filled-in magenta.
        Plus, we have highlighted, in magenta outline, a handy dominant seven chord,
         which we could play as a substitution if we wanted a Blues seventh.
        <br>
    <img src="img/help/multi-highlight.png">
    </li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>Click the 'keep' radio button, to avoid making changes when scrolling
 around.</p>

 <p><img src="img/help/keep.png"></p>

<p>Click the 'clear' radio button to delete a note of the kind selected (Named, Single, Tiny, Bend).</p>

 <p><img src="img/help/clear.png"></p>


<h3>Note Types -- special handling:</h3>
<p><img style="border: 20px solid green;" src="img/help/REC-button.png"></p>
<p>
<pre>        &check;To keep highlights: record them in individual Beats within Setions.
            &diams; Highlights you get when "REC" is inactive are not kept in the Section.

        &check;NamedNotes persist in Sections, but can't be recorded in Beats.

        &check;SingleNotes, Tiny notes, and Bends persist in Sections, and can be recorded in beats.

      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&dot;&nbsp;&nbsp; set the enharmonic choice of sharps or flats for the key of the Section.
 </p>

  <h4 style="margin-left: 4em;">Section :: Destination</h4>

 <p>When moving, creating or cloning Sections, pay attention to the dropdown called "Destination after &sect;".  This is where
     the new/moved Section ends up.  So chosing "Destination after &sect;" of 3 creates or moves to Section 4.  Chosing
     "BEGIN" as the Destination creates or moves to Section 1, pushing the existing Section 1 to Section 2,
     and bumping all other Sections later as well.
 </p>
 <h4 style="margin-left: 4em;">Section :: Transposition</h4>
 <p>If the "Allow transposition by keyboard shortcuts d, U, u, D,  j , & J" checkbox is checked, then these
     keyboard shortcuts work; otherwise they don't.
     This prevents you from inadvertently transposing a Section, which is confusing if you don't notice the transposition hint.
     The hint is that all the NamedNotes move (which you might miss),
     and a yellow highlight is placed around all the new Root notes
     (which only hangs out until you click a note or change sections).
</p>
<p>Transposing "Up" moves the notes and the Root Key up the scale one half-step.  Transposing with the "j" key ("Jump") moves the notes
    and the Root up a fourth, which is up one string on a P4 instrument.  Remember that Jumping up a fourth from the G string
    to the B string in Standard guitar tuning will not be on the same fret.
</p>
<p>
    Here we show a Section with a C major chord shown in NamedNotes (all legal notes on the neck) which <i>will</i> move
    when we transpose.
    We have added a B-flat SingleNote, which is the dominant seven.
    Since it is a SingleNote, it <i>won't</i> move when we transpose.
    (Also, all SingleNotes have a thin yellow backglow so they look different from NamedNotes,
    much thinner than the fat yellow Highlight which surrounds the entire cell.)
</p>
<p>
        Transposing from C to D-flat then looks like this:
 </p>


 <p>
    Before:
    <br>
    <img class="floatingScreenshot" width="60%" src="img/help/context/transpose-C-up-before.png">
 </p>
 <p>
     After:
     <br>
     <img class="floatingScreenshot"  width="60%" src="img/help/context/transpose-C-up-after.png">
 </p>
 <p>Notice that the C major chord is now a D-flat major chord, that all D-flats are highlighted with a fat, yellow Highlight to show you the new Root,
     and that the B-flat SingleNote is still a B-flat, but its Note Function has changed from the dominant seven to the six,
     since its relative position to the Root has changed (it was two strings up from the Root, same fret; now it
     is still two strings up, but one fret back).
     You can see the new Root key in the caption bar of the instrument: a small, sunken box has a D-flat where before it had a C.
     You can also see that AutoColor has shown the Note Functions being the same in the new key, since AutoColor assigns colors
     to Note Function, regardless of NoteName or Root Key.  In this AutoColor ColorScheme ("CycleOfColors"), the Root is black, the V is red,
     and the III is a kelly green.  In this scheme, Dominant seven (&delta;) is a pool blue, while the 6 is a chartreuse green.
 </p>
<h4 style="margin-left: 4em;">Section :: Key Change</h4>
<p>
    If we had just wanted to change keys but leave all the notes, we would just change the key of
    the Section with the dropdown "Key", which would look like this:
</p>
<p>
   Before (Root = C):
   <br>
   <img class="floatingScreenshot" width="30%" src="img/help/context/key-change-C-Dflat-before.png">
</p>

<p>
    After (Root = D-flat):
    <br>
    <img class="floatingScreenshot"  width="30%" src="img/help/context/key-change-C-Dflat-after.png">
</p>

<p>Notice that the notes stayed in the same positions, but the keys have changed.
    (The Note Names are still [C,E,G] on the same frets and strings.)
    Thus all the notes have new Note Functions.
    Since AutoColor is on, the notes automatically get new colors--AutoColor assigns a color per Note Function.
</p>




<a name="divViewControls"></a>
<h3>View</h3>

<p>All the controls on this page update the fretboard display in real-time.
     All can be saved to the Section Display Options, such that
     when you navigate to another Section, the Display Options you saved will be restored upon coming back to this Section.
</p>

<p>
     If you want to save these options, it is best to set them at least in the first Section, so that when looping
     the song, or opening the song from a file, the default options you chose get restored logically.  When you navigate to
     another section, the options persist until you hit another section that has Display Options set.  As you change Sections,
     if the View menu is showing, you'll see the option controls get updated.
</p>

<p>Also click Save Display Options to overwrite previously saved options for just the current Section.
</p>

<p>Click Clear Display Options to delete these options for just the current Section.
</p>

<p>These buttons also appear in the Section menu, and apply to the current Section.
</p>

<p>You can audit all the Display Options for all Sections that have them set with the Command-Line <span class="menuExampleLine"><b><small>/vdd</small></b></span>
     Scroll down to see the audit
     of all Sections with Display Options.  The options that change are highlighted.  You can also sit on the View page and
     watch the controls change while you hit the Transport next section buttons, or the keyboard shortcuts ( &lt; and &gt; ).
     Remember that if one of the controls traps the keyboard, click in some blank spot of the screen or hit <span class="key">ESC</span> and then V to
     come back to the View menu.
 </p>

<p>You can play around with the following options:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Show Right Subscript
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Show Right Subscript in Center
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Show Left Subscript
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Show MIDI Number
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right Subscript: Function | Notename
<br>
<br>

These will render various results like these, which you can also tweak with the sizing options.
<br>
For all these examples, "Show Left Subscript" and "Show Right Subscript" are checked.

<a name="divThemeControls"></a>
<h3>Themes</h3>
 <p>Normally, you can change Themes by just selecting one from the dropdown in the main menu button bar.
 </p>
 <p>The Theme menu is for tweaking the current Theme, and for building new Themes.  It's a bit techie, so we'll
     explain it in a video at some point.
 </p>

<a name="divFillNotes"></a>
<h3>Fill</h3>
 <p>Fills in order of: Scale, Chord, Root.
         <br>
         <br>
         &bull;&nbsp;To fill just Scale, set Chord and Root to "Keep".
         <br>
         <br>
         &bull;&nbsp;To fill Scale and Chord, set Root to "Keep".
         <br>
         <br>
         &bull;&nbsp;To erase, select "None" for color and click "Fill Notes" again.
         <br>
         <br>
         &bull;&nbsp;AutoColor chooses colors based on the note function colors: [note1, note2, ... note12],
         which overrides noteChord, noteScale, and noteRoot.
         <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;So to see the color effect of filling, AutoColor button should be <span class="BtnPunchedOut">punched out</span>, not <span class="BtnPunchedIn">punched in</span>  .
 </p>

<a name="divTunings"></a>
<h3>Tunings</h3>
  <p>Look under the "Tunings" menu to turn on and off various installed tunings,
      and customize them (number of frets, left-handed).  These controls update the
      instruments in real-time, but you may have to scroll down to see them.
      </p>

<a name="palette"></a>
<h3>Palette</h3>
 <p>The Palette lets you choose what kind of note you'll be placing when you click in a cell,
     and what color and hatching will be used.
 </p>

 <p>First, choose what kind of note: Named, Single, Tiny, Bend, Pitch Highlight, Multi Highlight, or Fingering.
     There's more detail in the <a href="#glossary">Glossary</a> about these note kinds.
 </p>

 <p>Then, decide whether you'll use AutoColor.  With AutoColor, Note Functions are
     assigned a color each by the current ColorScheme.
     Without AutoColor, more color buttons will appear: these are colors assigned to Roles.
     A Role is something like Root or Chord.  All Root notes then have the same color.  All Chord notes have the same color.
     (Except that we provide not just one but [Chord, Ch2, and Ch3],
     so that you can have three different chord colors to be assigned as you click.)
     If you just want a color for each note, that you'll assign, then click "More..." after the Major Seventh role color radio button.
     You'll then see the full palette infinite-neck provides.  Whenever AutoColor is active, your color choices for individual colors chosen this
     way will be ignored.
 </p>

 <p>AutoColor uses a ColorScheme.  infinite-neck comes with a Default ColorScheme, called "CycleOfColors", which is based
     on my whack theory that associating a color with each Note Function helps to learn and spot patterns of chords.  That is, a Major Seventh chord
     always looks the same, color-wise, so seeing an inversion of that chord on the neck should stimulate a memory, and help
     us navigate the pattern of that chord all around the neck.  If you find it weird or annoying, you have two options: 1) turn AutoColor off; 2) customize
     AutoColor to a scheme of your liking.
</p>

<p>
     Customization also allows you to have multiple ColorSchemes, for example,
     one scheme for minor moods, another for major moods.
</p>

<p>
     With AutoColor off, you can still have the colors and hatches mean something, by using Roles.
     A Role for Root or Chord was discussed above.
     You can also use or customize the Roles for Avoid, Avoid2 and Avoid3, so that these notes mean
     "Avoid this note!"  To do this, you would turn
     AutoColor off, then click Avoid, then click in a cell to place that Avoid note, either a SingleNote,
     or a NamedNote.  You can do this in multiple keys,
     such that in Section 1, in the key of C, the flat II (&tau;) would be an Avoid note, while in Section 2,
     in the key of A playing a
     <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy_scale">Gypsy scale</a> where the
     flat 2 (&tau;) is legal, then the natural 2 (II)
     would be an Avoid note, so you'd place a Role note of Avoid there.
 </p>

 <p>Customizing the colors for the Roles [Root, Chord, and Scale] sets these as the colors for the Fill menu.  When using Fill,
     you probably want AutoColor off to take advantage of this.
 </p>

 <p>To change ColorScheme away from CycleOfColors, click the [Customize...] button on the Palette menu.
     Chose colors and hatches for
     each of the Note Functions [note1, note2, ....,note12] using the little picker buttons and their pop-up pickers.
     (Click the little button again to make the picker go away, or click a
     color/hatch to chose it and make the picker go away.)
     When you have colors selected for each of the Note Functions [note1,...,note12],
     then click the [Record Stylesheet] button.  You can provide a Stylesheet name,
     or the name "user" will be filled in for you.  Now the Stylesheets will be shown,
     the same as if you had clicked the [Stylesheets] button, and your new Stylesheet will be a the bottom of the list.
     The bottom row is the composite stylesheet of built-in stylesheets plus your user stylesheets, as selected with the links
     and checkboxes, which you can play around with.  This result is your active ColorScheme, and is saved in the song.
     To apply it to other songs, open this song first, delete any Sections, then open the Song you want to view
     using the "Append sections to current song" checkbox on the File menu.
     (There always has to be one Section, so just mash on the Delete Section button repeatedly in the Section
     menu until you are down to one Section and it is blank.)  Now when you open the other song, you'll see that song's
     Sections, along with its saved Stylesheets, and your new Stylesheet.
 </p>

 <p>You can also customize the colors for Fingering the same way.  You'll see that the Default stylesheets are broken up
     into CycleOfColors for Note Functions, Fingerings for fingering colors, and Roles for Role colors.  You may overide any of the
     individual colors in your stylesheet, and leave some Roles or Fingers or Note Functions as Default by not adding things in your stylesheet.
     You may also have multiple stylesheets by entering different names in "Stylesheet name" before clicking "Record Stylesheet".
 </p>

 <p>There is another way to record a stylesheet: manually place colored NamedNotes on the neck, then click Section:NamedNotes==&gt;Stylesheet.
     This will create a stylesheet for the Note Functions only, based on the colors you chose for those Note Function locations.
     You do not need to do all Note Functions--you could just override the II and the &Delta; for example.  Then, when AutoColor is on
     the two notes in your stylesheet would override the Default, but other notes would use the Default.
 </p>

 <p>Finally, there are several special "Color" buttons: [Clear, Keep, and Find Color].
</p>

<p>
     "Keep" disables placing new notes,
     so is useful if you just want to click around and not change anything, or if you are doing a presentation
     and don't want to mess things up.
</p>

<p>
 "Clear" lets you delete notes of the kind
     selected.  Actually, you can also just click on a note, and if you have the note kind selected,
     that note will go away.  If you click again,
     the note will come back, but with whatever color you currently have active.
</p>

<p>
     To find what color you used before, make sure AutoColor is off, then click "Find Color", then click the note
     on the neck.  The color name will appear in the Caption of that instrument, so open up the Caption row
     with the little hamburger on the instrument.
     If the whole Caption on the instrument is missing, press ESC then SHIFT-A to show it.
     The color will also be highlighted on the Palette, so you
     will have to have AutoColor off, and you should click "More..." after the [&Delta;] radio button to show
     the full color palette.
 </p>

 <p>Two more colors are special: [Emboss, and Auto].  Emboss just creates a note with transparent background.  This is useful
     if you'll be using AutoColor, so as to be obvious when AutoColor is off--all the notes will just be transparent but still have borders, highlights, etc.
     Emboss is also useful if you'd like to just display the Named Notes so you can see their positions all the way up the neck,
     and then use color to draw your attention to SingleNotes that you'll actually play.
 </p>
 <p>The color called "Auto" places notes with a color selected by AutoColor, but that color persists even when AutoColor is off.
     This is useful if you want the colors from a ColorScheme to apply while placing notes, but you don't want to use AutoColor
     because you are using color Roles, or are using Emboss.

 <h2>Options</h2>
 <p>Beware that keyboard shortcuts may be captured by textboxes such as the song name or BPM, or even the
     radio buttons of colors on the Palette.  Hit <span class="key">ESC</span> to close up menus to ensure the keyboard shortcuts documented
     here behave as expected.</p>

 <p class="GUIReference">Menu :: View :: Natural fret widths</p>
 <p>When checked, pressing <span class="key">w</span> or <span class="key">W</span> while menus are closed will increase/decrease the
     width of the frets, but will use the natural mathematical proportion of frets, such that they
     get smaller up the neck. This is the default.  When not checked, the <span class="key">w</span> and <span class="key">W</span> keys still increase and decrease, but all frets have
     the same width.
 </p>
 <p>Certain instruments in the library have an option in the JSON file called <b>fixedFretWidthMult</b>
     which scales the fixed width, and thus do not use Natural Fret Widths.
     <b>Piano Schroeder</b> is one of these.
 </p>

 <p class="GUIReference">Menu :: Section :: Allow transposition by keyboard shortcuts <span class="key">t</span>,

 <p>When checked, pressing <span class="key">t</span> or <span class="key">T</span> while menus are closed will transpose
 any named-notes, preserving their role colors/styles. Pressing <span class="key">j</span> or <span class="key">J</span>
 will transpose by fourths,
 or <b><u>J</u></b>ump strings up or down.

 When not checked, these keys cannot
 trigger transposition, which is the safe default.</p>

 <a name="graveyard"></a>

<h2>The Graveyard</h2>
<p>Objects that are deleted are buried in the Graveyard.
    They can be revived, which will place them back into the song as though never deleted,
    except perhaps in a different order if things have been added or deleted in the meantime.  See the help sections
on how to move Sections and Beats.  The order of Stylesheets is part of setting the Stylesheets for a Song, so check the
Stylesheet order
(in <span class="GUIReferenceInline" >Palette | <span style="border: 1px solid gray; background-color: lightgreen;">Stylesheets</span></span> ) after reviving them.</p>


<p>The Graveyard can be found under the File menu, and in the Command-Line under <span class="menuExampleLine"><b>/fg</b> (<b>f</b>ile <b>g</b>raveyard)</span>.</p>

<p>Click "show/hide" to see the object that was buried.</p>
<p>Click "raise" to revive the object that was buried.  The "lastRevived" timestamp will be updated,
    and the object will be placed back into the song.</p>
<p>In fact, you can revive an object more than once.  This makes clones, which is useful.

            key and arrow keys are not overriden,
                so all keyboard navigation
            should work.  <i>(However, we remove all the transport buttons from TAB order,
                and other controls you can reach by the Command-Line
            or keyboard shortcuts.)</i>  So tabbing to the hamburger button means
            <span class="key">SPACE</span> will click the hamburger, as usual.  Tabbing to radiobuttons
            lets you then use arrow keys to select different colors, for example.  There is one radio group for all the Note types, and one
            radio group for the colors.  Once you are in the palette, however, a <span class="key">p</span> key will get trapped by the radio buttons.  So to
            exit the palette, you must use <span class="key">ESC</span>.

                The function is where a note sits in the mode or scale you are playing.  So if the band switches to the key
                of A, that G note becomes the dominant seven, because we count from A up seven scale-tones.  This would be
                the case if we were playing in A Mixolydian.  If we were in A major, the mode has G# as the major seven, so the G
                is a flatted G#--that is, <i>not</i> in the major mode.  <span class="productsmaller">infinite-neck</span> deals
                with this by assigning a unique symbol to each Note Function: a dominant seven is &delta; and a major seven is &Delta;.

            <td>A special type of TinyNote, which shows the range of notes that bending (stretching) a string moves through.
                For example, if you finger a note at A, but then stretch the string sideways,
                it will raise the pitch smoothly through A#, G, and maybe even G# if you have light strings or are high up on the neck.
                <span class="productsmaller">infinite-neck</span> designates the cell where your bend starts with a square end, and the
                destination note as the pointed end.  In the same example, A is the start, A#, G and G# are the destination notes.  A# would be
                a semitone bend, G would be a 2-semitone bend, and G# a 3-semitone bend. A pre-bend is where you bend the note up before
                plucking the string, and then release the tension so that the pitch drops--the destination is then A.
                <span class="productsmaller">infinite-neck</span> calls it an "up-down" bend where you start off relaxed, sound the note, then bend up
                and then release the tension so the pitch comes back down.

                so that you can show chords that change on the beat, then you'd create a Section with 16 beats.  This would be useful
                if you wanted to show the "fabric" of the groove with NamedNotes, and then use SingleNotes to show actual notes to play.

                In a Funk jam, there are typically two Sections--when the bass player changes the Root, that would be the second
                Section, and when the Bass player goes back, we'd be back in the first section, regardless of whether we hung on the first Root
                for 8 bars.  Alternately, some jams have two separate bass Root notes per bar, while the mode stays basically the same.  These can be modeled
                as two Sections per bar.

                When you are placing notes in <span class="productsmaller">infinite-neck</span>, you are looking
                at the neck in one Section.  Within this section, as the Beats roll by, SingleNotes, TinyNotes, and Highlights
                can move around, but everything else stays the same.  Specifically, the NamedNotes keep their positions for the
                entire Section.  In one Section, the things that stay the same are: Caption, Root Key, Lead Root Key, Display Options,
                Theme, and the enharmonic display of key (A# versus G&#9837;).
                When you go to the next Section, you get a new collection of recorded notes in Beats.
                That is, Section 1 could have two beats with up to 2 sets of recorded notes;
                 Section 2 could have 16 beats with up to 16 sets of recorded notes.

                To change these on each Beat, record (press "Rec"), then click the notes you want, then change
                to the next Beat with the Transport or keyboard shortcut without changing Section.  When done, turn off recording.
                You can then Loop Beats, or Loop the Song, to see your work.  You can place notes while looping, but you gotta be fast,
                or set the BPM to be slow, while editing.  A Beat is associated with the BPM (Beat Per Minute).  So at 80 BPM, you'll get 80 beats in one minute.
                If you had 8 beats to Section 1, and 8 beats to Section 2, looping over these two Sections would yeild 5 loops in one minute.
                Each Section may have different number of Beats.  If you are matching a song in 4/4 at 80 BPM, then put 4 Beats
                in each Section.  If you want to show fingering on the 1/8th note, put 8 Beats per Section, and set BPM to 160.

                Fill allows you to color these in different colors.  So you could play in C, playing [C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C] and these would
                be the scale notes for Cmajor, with a Root of C.  If you played [C,D,E,F,G,A,B&#9837;,C] you could say you were
                playing C Mixolydian, so C is the Root, and these notes are the Scale notes.  An appropriate Chord would then be C7
                (C dominant 7).  <span class="productsmaller">infinite-neck</span> allows you to Fill the neck with NamedNotes
                using Chords and Scale notes (including modes) that are not necessarily in the key.  So if you set the key to C,
                then fill with a m7b5 chord and Locrian scale, you'll notice that the m7b5 chord fits over the Locrian mode scale notes,
                but that most of these are not in C major scale.  So really, you aren't in C major, but in C Locrian, and it works
                perfectly with a C m7b5.  These are all available in the Fill menu dropdowns.
