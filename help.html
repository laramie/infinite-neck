    <p class="bigpoint">This tool helps you visualize notes across the neck of your instrument.
        </p>

        <p><img src="img/help/infinite-neck-visualization.png" width="80%"></p>


    <p>Clicking on cells puts "notes" on the virtual neck (fretboard),
        showing where you'll play them on the real fretboard of your instrument.  You can add bars and beats, and loop the song.
        There's music theory baked into the tool, so you can automatically
        highlight all legal notes in G Mixolydian, for example, with separate sets of colors for
        chord notes, root, scale notes, passing-tones, and blue-notes.
    </p>
    <p>infinite-neck has the following uses for practice and sharing:
        <br>&check;&nbsp;writing down new-to-you and interesting chord fingerings.
        <br>&check;&nbsp;capturing a concrete way to play a song.
        <br>&check;&nbsp;communicating the fabric of a sound: the possible notes and their moods.
        <br>&check;&nbsp;creating art with the patterns of notes, another way to internalize the layout and relationships of notes.
        <br>&check;&nbsp;improvising over the changes while looping.
    </p>

    <h3>Instruments</h3>
    <p>
        &check;&nbsp;Supported instruments: guitar, bass, mandolin, cello, piano, midi-pads, uke, and banjo.
        <br>
        &check;&nbsp;All support left-handed and right-handed players.
        <br>
        &check;&nbsp;Each instrument may have multiple tunings.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, a left-handed, six-string guitar could be in Standard tuning,
        or it could be in P4, Drop-D, or DADGAD.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is the tunings table, which shows all tunings for all supported instruments. (<small><i>It's easy to add your own tunings.</i></small>)

<h3>infinite-neck Walk-through</h3>


<p>Here is a blank song, with a Theme that shows the piano key coloring scheme (i.e. Ebony/Ivory) as a backdrop for each fret:
    <br />
    <img src="img/help/blank-song.png" width="80%"></p>

    <p>Here are a P4-tuning 6-string guitar, and a Standard-tuning left-hand 6-string,
        both playing a cowboy-chord D-major, and showing those notes across the necks.
        They are in editing mode with titles and controls, and are displayed in the same workspace.
    </p>
    <p><img width="600px" src="img/help/two-guitars-p4-std-L-editing.png"></p>


    <p>Here they are in full-screen mode.</p>
    <p><img width="600px" src="img/help/two-guitars-p4-std-L-fullscreen.png"></p>

    <p class="bigpoint">You can assign colors and styles to notes.</p>
    <p>For example: named notes (C#), chord notes (I, III, V), scale notes (natural minor),
    mode notes (Mixolydian), enclosure notes, or passing tones can all have different colors and styles so you can visualize these patterns up the neck.
    </p>

    <p><img  width="600px" src="img/help/c-mixolydian.png"></p>

    <p class="bigpoint">You can create Sections, and Beats within Sections.</p>
    <p>A Section is like a bar or multiple bars where the underlying notes, modes, and keys don't change.
    Within a section, a beat can highlight any notes.  The next beat could highlight different notes, but "Named Notes" stay for the whole section.
    </p>

    <p>Each new section gets: new keys, number of beats, caption, enharmonic sharps/flats.</p>

    <p>That is, a Song has one or more Sections, and each Section has one or more Beats.</p>


        <p>Each beat's length (time duration) is determined with the "BPM", or "Beats Per Minute" setting,
            and there can be any number of beats per section, from 1 to some large integer.</p>

        <p class="bigpoint">You can then loop over the Beats in one Section, or in all Sections.</p>

            <p><img src="img/help/transport.png">
            <br><i>Transport showing Section 1 of 5, on Beat 3 of 4.</i></p>

        <p  class="bigpoint">You can save your songs to share with someone or to come back and practice them later.</p>

    <p>Within Sections, one key is the root key for the band, and optionally, a separate root key for the "lead".
        <i>("Bill is playing F# over Dave and the band's B".)</i></p>


    <p>To show four chord changes over, say, a Dmin mood, you could use one Section with four Beats,
        or you could use four Sections.</p>

        <p>With four beats in one Section, the neck would look like, say,
            a sea of bluish notes with several notes highlighted in golden backlight.
            <ul>
                <li>the chord changes would be shown by MultiHighlight or by MidiHighlight,
                    which highlight just the relevant notes across the neck(s) with golden box-shadows.
                </li>
                <li>the band is in multiple blue colors, e.g. slightly different colors for the I, the V, the minor 3, the Seven.
                </li>
                <li>these notes keep the same position and color for all beats in this Section.
                </li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Or, with four Sections, the neck would look like a sea of bluish notes, and as each section is played,
            you'd see notes change style and color, forming one chord per Section with their color changes,
            that are different than the Dmin mood,
        and so draw your eyes to the chosen notes/positions within a whole fabric of playable notes.
        You can also add beats (Highlights) to these Sections for more expression.</p>

        <p>I find it essential, when communicating with musicians, to "think Piano".  So in addition to the note
            markers, or fret positions that you <i>should</i> play, <i>should <b>not</b></i> play, <i>could</i> play...etc.,
            I have styled the guitar necks with piano key coloring embeded as ivory and ebony box inlay,
        though in software they look more like lit-up MIDI controllers built
        into your guitar neck like Guitar Hero with half of Synesthesia bolted on.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="70%" src="img/help/highlights.png"></p>

    <p>That is, <i>ahem,</i> a Song has one or more Sections, and each Section has one or more Beats.</p>

<a name="why"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Why</h2>

         <p>Obviously, the neck is NOT infinite,
             since we play instruments with a fixed number of strings, and a playable number of frets,
             generating a listenable set of tones.
             (But you <i>could</i> have an infinite number of
             frets, since they get infinitely smaller as you approach the bridge, albeit infinitely more unplayable.)</p>

        <p>And thinking about the neck as infinite helped me to learn the repeatable patterns of the neck, and not
             be rooted to the nut or open strings as much.  <i><small>In fact, I use open strings more now as drone notes
             while I'm playing high up on the neck, because going up the neck doesn't unroot me from the scale I'm playing.</small></i>
        </p>

         <p>The point is that the instrument that
             got me started on this madness was the Strandberg Boden <b><i>8-string</i></b> guitar with <b>24 frets</b>!  It seemed infinite to me!  </p>

        <p><img  width="40%" src="img/help/strandberg-boden.png"></p>
         <p>Also,
             deciding to play this beast meant that when switching to 8-string bass (or 5-string bass),
             I'd have to know different layouts than Standard guitar tuning.
             So I decided for my own practice, I would use Perfect-Fourth-Tuning (P4)
             on this 8-string guitar and all my basses.  Soon, the
             logic and playability of this P4 system led me to convert some of my 6-string guitars to P4.
             My soloing and comping
             advanced remarkably.  <i><small>I never realized that the part of my brain that likes to improvise
             gets all anxious and goes away when I hit that major third between the G and B strings
             and I play a real clam because I'm missing a half-step.</small></i></p>

         <p>Along the way, I had to sort out where my Classical training and Jazz training had different names
                 for the pitches of a scale, and what to call these enharmonically <i><small>
                     (classical purists note--here we show your choice of [all sharps] or [all flats] in any key,
                     per Section, but no weird enharmonic names or mixed sharps and flats--sorry, no B# or C## for you!)</small></i>,
                     and what to call these pitches when the key changed,
                 but the played note was the same.
                 <i>e.g. the band jumps from the key of A to the key of D# and you want to play the minor third function in the new key,
                 or you want to know what that minor third you were playing in A means, now that everyone else is playing in D#.
                 <small>"Girl from Ipanema" anyone?</small></i>

         <p>So I decided to share this tool and to include other tunings, and ambidexterity,
             so you can use this tool in your instrument and tuning of choice.
             </p>

         </p>
         <p>You'll want to use this tool to:
             <ul>
                 <li>Understand Laramie's system of scale note/function naming (a hybrid between Jazz and Classical conventions),
                     and its uses for singing, playing, and visualizing modal and modeless playing.
                 <li>Try the benefits of Ebony/Ivory visualization from the piano, brought to the guitar.
                     Especially when learning modes or playing in "The People's Key".
                 <li>Apprehend the patterns formed by scales and chords across and up the neck.
                 <li>Move these patterns around the neck.
                 <li>Watch lead patterns moving against patterns of comping, and practice improvising over the patterns and changes.
                 <li>See the difference between tunings in real time
             (pull up two tunings and press Ctrl-minus in your browser to make them both fit).
                 <li>Practice a song someone has saved in some other tuning, by switching it to your tuning.
             </ul>

        <p><small><i>Classical music theory provides only 7 note names, and then expects you to glue on words
            like "augmented", "diminished", "altered", "major", and "minor".
            The problem is the symbols can change, so that for example the "II" becomes "ii" if diatonic,
            which makes it minor.  Add Jazz people and you'll hear "flat 9" or "the flat 2".
            And half of the Classical folks reading wouldn't agree that it would be correct
            to notate a 12-tone chromatic scale thusly:
            I ii II iii III IV v V vi VI vii VII.  Because ii represents the minor mode and not the flatted II.

            These examples don't explain the problems well, or even correctly, but that's
            kind of the point.  These systems do not precisely address what I want to
            express: a unique set of single letter names for each of the twelve tones of the chromatic scale.
            I do this by assigning names concretely, which apply in any 12-tone
            playing, assuming you know where the "root" is, or the key of the band or dominant instrument,
            usually the bass player.  I used symbols familiar to Jazz and Session players, and added a few new ones
            where singular, concrete names were needed.
            </i></small></p>

            <p>Features of the system
                <ul>
                    <li>The "Name" is my name for that symbol and function</li>
                    <li>The "Pronunciation" is my way of singing that symbol, for example "m" is named "mi" and is pronounced like the English word "my".</li>
                    <li>"Symbol" is also called Function, Function Name, or Note</li>
                    <li>A &Theta; is always 7 steps up from the root.</li>
                    <li>If you change root, the new &Theta; is calculated as 7 steps above the new root.</li>
                    <li>A III is always a major third.</li>
                    <li>An m is always a minor third, and so on.</li>
                    <li>It's easy to think of the notes as simple: one character, one syllable</li>
                    <li>I think the easiest to sing sounds are shown in my pronounciation--one syllable, ends in vowel.</li>

      <p>The best way to understand these is to fill up the neck with NamedNotes,

          <small><i>They update in real-time, but you may have to scroll to see the neck.</i></small>
      </p>

      <p>
          As you do that, the editing box called <b>Function Symbols</b> will get populated
          with the internal string of characters and HTML character entities.

      </p>

      <p>
            Setting the scheme <b>Function Numbers</b> for Function symbols:

        </p>

        <p>
            The Function Symbols get set to this:

            The notes display like this: <br />

        <h4>User-added alternatives</h4>
        <p>
             You can change the NoteFunction symbols to any string or HTML Entity you choose.
             A string is anything you can type on the keyboard; an HTML Entity is something like <b>&amp;blah;</b> where blah
             is some string of numbers and letters--the browser turns them into things you can't type, like symbols.
             You just need to edit the array here: <br><span class="GUIReferenceInline">View | Function Symbols</span>
        </p>

         <p>
             This is a Javascript array, so the commas, quotes and braces must remain exactly as they are--just
             change the values between the quote marks, leaving the quotes, commas and braces.
        </p>


      <br>
      <p>They default to this:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["I","&amp;tau;","II","m","III","IV","&amp;Theta;","V","&amp;sigma;","6","&amp;delta;","&amp;Delta;"]</div>
      <p>
          <img src="img/help/defaultNoteFunctionEntities.png">
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>Or you could go crazy and use lots of HTML Entities:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["&amp;#x21BA;","&amp;tau;","&amp;empty;","&amp;nabla;","&amp;oplus;","&amp;int;","&amp;Theta;","&amp;otimes;","&amp;sigma;","&amp;prod;","&amp;infin;","&amp;ocirc;"]</div>
      <br />
      <p>
          <img src="img/help/customNoteFunctionEntities.png">
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>Or use regular strings, such as Solf&#232;ge:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["Do","Ra","Re","Ma","Mi","Fa","Se","Sol","Le","La","Ta","Ti"]</div>
      <p>
          <img src="img/help/customNoteFunctionSolfage.png">
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>Early in the design phase, I tried extending the Classical notation to use chord function names as note function names.
          I find it confusing, being all too similar.
          Drop me a note if you have a better idea, but here is what that looks like:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 4em; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 12pt; ">["I","ii","II","iii","III","IV","v","V","vi","VI","vii","VII"]</div>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>A cell is one of the squares on the neck, and represents one fret on one string. </p>

<p><span class="productsmall">infinite-neck</span> allows you to mark the notes on your Instrument with various types of notes, shown below.  Otherwise,
    a cell is empty. (You can also choose to show all the note names in all cells, but these won't have an inner border
    or backglow behind them as notes do.)  When a cell has one or more notes or highlights, it is called "Active".</p>

<p>With the various types of notes, you can express notes which should be known anywhere on the neck, or which should
    be played exactly where shown.  With recording Beats and ordering the Sections, and with Looping, you can then arrange
    the song into a practice sheet, or a visualization of notes to play or notes you <i>could</i> play.
</p>

<p>To help you visualize
  the neck, <span class="productsmall">infinite-neck</span> shows where the piano keys would lie on your tuning.
  In most Themes, cells have a white background for white keys on the piano, and a gray background for black keys on the piano.
</p>

<p>Tunings may change on your guitar, but a C is always a white key, and a C&sharp; (or D&flat;) is always a black key.
You can switch to Theme "Coffee Brown" to see a keyboard that does not have piano key backgrounds.
And any Theme can be changed by choosing
the same color for noteWhiteKeyColor and noteBlackKeyColor in the Theme.</p>

<p>Here are six cells showing four white-keys, and two black-keys. A "Single" note is
placed on A, and a "NamedNote" is placed on F&sharp; which selects <u>all</u> F&sharp;s.</p>

<p><img src="img/help/one-cell.png"></p>

<p>Click a Palette note kind (Named, Single, Tiny, Bend...).</p>

<p><img src="img/help/palette-note-types.png"></p>

<p>Click a Palette radio button to select a note role, e.g. Root or Chord,</p>

<p><img src="img/help/palette.png"></p>


<p>or just some color you like.</p>

<p><img src="img/help/palette-more.png"></p>

<p>Click any cell.  Cells of that note name turn the selected color.
        <ul>
        <li>e.g. Click C, E, and G.</li>
        <li>Now with "Named" notes, you have all Cmajor chords shown.  </li>
        <li>With "Single" notes, you just
        have the cells you clicked.</li>
        <li>With "Tiny" notes and "Bend" notes, you'll have smaller note functions placed over the cells.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p>Click the Clear radio button, then any note name you want to clear.
    (These are specific to the kind of note, so also select the kind of note.)
</p>

<p>
Check the 'Highlight' checkbox to put a border around just one square,
e.g. to highlight the actual chord voicing you would play.
With "Pitch" and "Multi" notes, you'll just highlight those notes:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Pitch</b> shows all notes with one MIDI pitch (e.g. 62) on that instrument,
        <br>
    <img src="img/help/pitch.png">
    </li>
    <li><b>Multi</b> lets you highlight multiple notes at once, by played position.
        Here we are showing the D-major chord, with a handy dominant seven chord
        highlighted in magenta, which we could play as a substitution if we wanted a Blues seventh.
        <br>
    <img src="img/help/multi-highlight.png">
    </li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>Click the 'keep' radio button, to avoid making changes when scrolling
 around.</p>

 <p><img src="img/help/keep.png"></p>

<p>Click the 'clear' radio button to delete a note of the kind selected (Named, Single, Tiny, Bend).</p>

 <p><img src="img/help/clear.png"></p>


<h3>Note Types -- special handling:</h3>
<p><img style="border: 20px solid green;" src="img/help/REC-button.png"></p>
<p>
<pre>        &check;To keep highlights: record them in individual Beats within Setions.
            &diams; Highlights you get when "REC" is inactive are not kept in the Section.

        &check;NamedNotes persist in Sections, but can't be recorded in Beats.

        &check;SingleNotes, Tiny notes, and Bends persist in Sections, and can be recorded in beats.
           &diams; If "REC" is active, notes record into beats, as you click them
           &diams; If "REC" is inactive, notes record into the Section, that is, they persist for all the beats.

        &check;SingleNotes are like NamedNotes, but you only get one note, not all notes that match the note name.
            &diams;    So a NamedNote "F#" will select and color all F#'s on the neck.
            &diams;    A SingleNote "F#" will just color one F# cell: the one you clicked.
            &diams;    A SingleNote has a corner rounded off in its display, and a brighter default backglow.
</pre>
</p>

         &bull;&nbsp;AutoColor chooses colors based on the note function colors: [note1, note2, ... note12],
         which overrides noteChord, noteScale, and noteRoot.

 <p>Beware that keyboard shortcuts may be captured by textboxes such as the song name or BPM, or even the
     radio buttons of colors on the Palette.  Hit <span class="key">ESC</span> to close up menus to ensure the keyboard shortcuts documented
     here behave as expected.</p>

 <p class="GUIReference">Menu :: View :: Natural fret widths</p>
 <p>When checked, pressing <span class="key">w</span> or <span class="key">W</span> while menus are closed will increase/decrease the
     width of the frets, but will use the natural mathematical proportion of frets, such that they
     get smaller up the neck. This is the default.  When not checked, the <span class="key">w</span> and <span class="key">W</span> keys still increase and decrease, but all frets have
     the same width.
 </p>
 <p>Certain instruments in the library have an option in the JSON file called <b>fixedFretWidthMult</b>
     which scales the fixed width, and thus do not use Natural Fret Widths.
     <b>Piano Schroeder</b> is one of these.

 <p class="GUIReference">Menu :: Section :: Allow transposition by keyboard shortcuts <span class="key">t</span>,
     <span class="key">T</span>, <span class="key">j</span>, <span class="key">J</span> </p>
 <p>When checked, pressing <span class="key">t</span> or <span class="key">T</span> while menus are closed will transpose
 any named-notes, preserving their role colors/styles. Pressing <span class="key">j</span> or <span class="key">J</span>
 will transpose by fourths,
 or <b><u>J</u></b>ump strings up or down.

 When not checked, these keys cannot
 trigger transposition, which is the safe default.</p>

<h2>The Graveyard</h2>
<p>Objects that are deleted are burried in the Graveyard.
    They can be revived, which will place them back into the song as though never deleted,
    except perhaps in a different order if things have been added or deleted in the meantime.  See the help sections
on how to move Sections and Beats.  The order of Stylesheets is part of setting the Stylesheets for a Song, so check the
Stylesheet order
(in <span class="GUIReferenceInline" >Palette | <span style="border: 1px solid gray; background-color: lightgreen;">Stylesheets</span></span> ) after reviving them.</p>


<p>The Graveyard can be found under the File menu, and in the Command-Line under <span class="menuExampleLine"><b>/fg</b> (<b>f</b>ile <b>g</b>raveyard)</span>.</p>

<p class="GUIReference">Menu :: File :: View Graveyard</p>

<p><img style="border: 20px solid green;" src="img/help/viewGraveyard.png"></p>


<p>    (It is presented at the bottom of the page after all instruments, so scroll down if autoscroll doesn't take you there.)</p>

<p><img width="80%" style="border: 20px solid green;" src="img/help/graveyard.png"></p>

<p>Click "show/hide" to see the object that was burried.</p>
<p>Click "raise" to revive the object that was burried.  The "lastRevived" timestamp will be updated,
    and the object will be placed back into the song.</p>
<p>In fact, you can revive an object more than once.  This makes clones, which is useful.
    For Sections, there are more detailed cloning buttons on the Section menu page: Clone, and Shallow Clone.</p>

        In Chrome::Inspect you can use Developer tools to directly access the ObjectModel of the Song.

        Synopsize the "tables" collection:
           getSong().frames.forEach(function(a){console.log("id"+JSON.stringify(a.tables))});

        Delete all played notes (tables) in a song, leaving Named and Recorded notes only :
           getSong().frames.forEach(function(a){a.tables = {}; });

        Delete all Recorded notes:
           getSong().frames.forEach(function(a){a.recordedNotes = {}; });

        Set entire song to sharps:
           getSong().frames.forEach(function(a){a.sharps = true; });
